I'm attempting to solve AOC in Rust. I've followed the instructions [here](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc).

I'm more comfortable in golang, and ~I'll probably have more solutions on my 2024 branch [here](https://github.com/joshprzybyszewski/aoc2022/tree/2024)~ I've pivoted to focusing on learning Rust instead of having duplicate solutions.

I am attempting to use CodSpeed to see benchmarks. Check it out [here](https://codspeed.io/joshprzybyszewski/aocrust).
